The system has been evaluated on the TIME collection (\cite{TIME}) provided by the course staff. The collection consist of 423 documents and 10 queries with specified relevant documents.

\section{Basic System}
The basic system has been evaluated using only precision and recall, no performance considerations has been made. The results from a default implementation using cosine scoring mode are demonstrated by Figure \ref{fig:cosine}. The figure plots a line for each of the queries, $x$ and $y$ axis correspond to recall and precision, and point $i$ on each line correspond to a (precision,recall) value after inspecting top $i$ results. The diagram plots up-to 50 top results for each query.

The diagram is quite easy to understand by keeping in mind that a correct result will either increase both the precision and recall or keep them at 1.0. After the maximum number of correct results is achieved, the recall will stay at 1.0, while precision will drop. Wrong results always result in a drop in precision, while the recall value is kept at the same level.

As Figure \ref{fig:cosine} shows, the total search quality is somewhat poor - for two out of ten queries the first result is already irrelevant, and the highest possible recall value at precision level 1.0 is 0.6, while it is impossible to achieve a precision higher than 0.6 for a recall level at 1.0. The best combination of precision and recall altogether is slightly off (0.8, 0.8)

As the Okapi BM-25 has also been implemented, it was quite interesting to evaluate its performance against the cosine model. As Figure \ref{fig:okapi} shows, Okapi results in a great quality improvement. Only one query fails to on the correct top results, but it contains both correct results within top five results. Most of the queries success to achieve a combine recall-precision value greater than (0.7, 0.7), and most important one of the queries success also to achieve a value at (1.0, 1.0), while the worst performance (observed for query number four) is just the same as for the cosine model.
