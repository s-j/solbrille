{\bf Solbrille Search Engines} was designed and produced during the course project in TDT4215 'Web-Intelligence' at Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Spring 2009. All the work was performed by the four group members titled as authors of this report. Some of the ideas behind the search engine were inspired by {\it Brille} (buffer management) and {\bf Terrier} (modular query processing) search engines.

The authors would like to thank Truls A. Bj¿rklund for providing the source code of Brille which was the main inspiration source in an early phase of the search engine development.
